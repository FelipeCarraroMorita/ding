# dingsound
An oven timer ding sound function to be called once your code finishes running! (Yes, I'm serious)

## BUT WHY?!
To know when your code finish processing without having to look at the screen.

## Installation
`!pip install dingsound==0.0.3`


## How to use
`import dingsound as d`

There is **only 2 functions** in this package:
1. `d.ding()` for most offline IDE's
2. `d.ding2()` for Google Colab

Both do in a pratical manner the same stuff! Have fun.
